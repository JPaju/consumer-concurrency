# Consumer concurrency
Quick project to test how concurrency in a event consumer affects the performance.


## TODO
- [ ] Use JMH to run the benchmarks
- [ ] Add some CPU intensive stuff to processing function (like encoding and decoding JSON) to make it more realistic
- [ ] Setup Kafka in Docker to test the performance with real infrastrucure
